#' generate.coterminous.xwalk
#'
#' If two regions are known to be co-terminous, this will generate a xwalk
#' between them. This method is more reliable than other obvious methods, which
#' can be thrown off by irregular shapes or differing resolutions between the
#' spatial datasets. Put the smaller region first. Will return 1 row/smaller
#' geo.
#' @param smaller.geo sf object containing the smaller geometries. (Because this
#'   is for coterminous regions, 1 set should be consistently smaller or the
#'   same size as the other)
#' @param larger.geo sf object containing larger geos.
#' @param trim.smaller Whether or not to trim smaller geos to combined area of
#'   all larger ones. Necessary, for example, if larger geos are clipped to
#'   water lines or otherwise trimmed, and the smaller ones are not. (In these
#'   cases, the smaller geometry is known to be smaller, but its spatial
#'   representation may not actually be). This step can be very computationally
#'   expensive for larger areas

#' get.spatial.overlap
#'
#' Calculates the % overlap between two geographies. Takes two sf objects, a
#' unique/row identifier column for each; returns a row for each combination of
#' rows in the input sfs that intersect with one another with a column for the
#' percent overlap. % overlap can indicate true overlap, or it can be an
#' artifact of differing resolutions between the shapefiles or other artifacts
#' of their representation. Filtering to geometries below a very small % overlap
#' using \code{filter.threshold} or otherwise can remove these slivers.

#'   below which to trim results before returning.
